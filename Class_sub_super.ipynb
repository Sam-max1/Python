    "### Key Points About Subclasses and Superclasses:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Inheritance Syntax**: Use parentheses after the class name to specify the superclass:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Subclass(Superclass):\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **super() Function**: Use `super()` to call methods from the superclass:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   super().__init__(parameters)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Method Override**: Subclasses can override methods from their superclass by defining a method with the same name.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Multiple Inheritance**: Python supports multiple inheritance, allowing a class to inherit from multiple superclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Method Resolution Order (MRO)**: Python uses MRO to determine which superclass method to call when there are naming conflicts in multiple inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember:\n",
    "- Always call the superclass's `__init__` method when overriding it in a subclass\n",
    "- Use meaningful class names that reflect the inheritance hierarchy\n",
    "- Follow the \"is-a\" relationship rule when creating inheritance relationships\n",
    "- Be careful with multiple inheritance to avoid complexity and naming conflicts"
