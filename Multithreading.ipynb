    "### Key Points to Remember:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)**:\n",
    "   - Python's GIL means threads can't run truly parallel for CPU-bound tasks\n",
    "   - Best for I/O-bound operations (network, file operations)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Thread Safety**:\n",
    "   - Use `Lock` for thread synchronization\n",
    "   - Avoid sharing mutable state between threads\n",
    "   - Use thread-safe data structures from `queue` module\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Thread Communication**:\n",
    "   - Use `Event` for signaling between threads\n",
    "   - Use `Queue` for passing data between threads\n",
    "   - Use `Condition` for complex synchronization\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Best Practices**:\n",
    "   - Always join threads before program exit\n",
    "   - Use daemon threads for background tasks\n",
    "   - Handle exceptions within threads\n",
    "   - Use thread pools for managing multiple workers\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **When to Use Threading**:\n",
    "   - I/O-bound tasks (file operations, network calls)\n",
    "   - GUI applications\n",
    "   - Concurrent tasks that don't require true parallelism\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that due to Python's GIL, multithreading is most effective for I/O-bound tasks. For CPU-bound tasks, consider using multiprocessing instead."
