    "### Key Points to Remember:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Process Creation**:\n",
    "   - Use `Process` class for individual processes\n",
    "   - Use `Pool` class for managing multiple worker processes\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Sharing**:\n",
    "   - Use `Queue` for inter-process communication\n",
    "   - Use `Value` and `Array` for shared memory\n",
    "   - Processes don't share memory by default\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Best Practices**:\n",
    "   - Always protect the entry point with `if __name__ == '__main__':`\n",
    "   - Use `join()` to wait for processes to complete\n",
    "   - Properly close and clean up resources\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **When to Use Multiprocessing**:\n",
    "   - CPU-bound tasks\n",
    "   - Tasks that can run independently\n",
    "   - When you need to bypass the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Common Issues to Watch For**:\n",
    "   - Deadlocks in process communication\n",
    "   - Resource consumption with too many processes\n",
    "   - Proper error handling across processes\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that multiprocessing is best suited for CPU-intensive tasks that can run in parallel. For I/O-bound tasks, consider using asyncio or threading instead."
